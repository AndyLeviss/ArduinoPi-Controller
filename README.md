# ArduinoPi Controller
The ArduinoPi controller is a web-based solution to control your Arduino using a RaspberryPi.
The controller uses AJAX and PHP, this github demonstrates some of the possibilities. The communication between
the RaspberryPi and the Arduino is possible thanks to the [php_serial.class.php](http://code.google.com/p/php-serial/).

I also want to thank the following authors/scripts/plugins for making my coding easier:
* [Twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Farbtastic Color Picker](http://acko.net/blog/farbtastic-jquery-color-picker-plug-in/)
* [Combining jQuery UI and Farbtastic](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2011/03/22/jquery-color-picker-using-farbtastic-and-jquery-ui/)

Warning: Before checking out the repo, please make sure you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, PHP and jQuery (and C++)

## Basic Commands
An example of a command.  
`@6,255:`  
If we send this command, using the sendCommand function in PHP, the Arduino will execute analogWrite on **port 6** with a value of **255**.  
The "@" marks the start of a command while ":" marks the end. The port value must be between 0-99 before the Arduino can switch the port (on a Mega 2560 there are around 99 ports).
 
Also note that only PWM ports can have values between 0-255, digital ports only accept a 0 or 255. Sending a value of 127 to a digital port will end in weird results!  

## Special commands
There are also a couple of special commands, but feel free to clone the repository and add your own (it's really easy!)

###Sending an RGB color
Sending an RGB color to some RGB LEDs can be quite frustrating and slow if you have to send 3 basic commands.
  
`@101,0,126,23:`  

The following command can also be send with the sendCommand function. Any value above 100 tells the Arduino we are using a special command, in this example the following 3 values represent an RGB color an can be used to switch RGB LEDS or RGB led strips.         

###Requesting sensor data
Sending the following code will request the an analogRead command on the desired pin.
        
`@102,6`  
             
102 indicates an Analog reading and 6 indicates the pin to do the reading on. By calling the request_sensor function an analog port can be read. The function asks for a filename and the specific analog port. The php function will then request the value and write it with a date stamp in a json file. This file can be read by jQuery and the result is displayed.
